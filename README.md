<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

Welcome to BloomCrafter! This guide will help you set up and run the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- npm (Node package manager)
  ```sh
  npm install npm@latest -g
  ```
- Git (to clone the project repository)

### Installation

1. Clone the BloomCraft2 repository to your local machine:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/394-w24/BloomCraft2.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd BloomCraft2
3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   
### Deploying to Firebase
This project was originally deployed to Firebase. If you would like to use Firebase as well, [please refer to this comprehensive guide on setting up Firebase](https://courses.cs.northwestern.edu/394/guides/firebase-notes.php).

You will probably want to use Firebase hosting services. If you wish to expand this project and include ways to add to the database within the app, you should initialize a firebase database. We recommend Realtime DB because the data is stored as a json.

As you will see, most of the static data (flower images, flower details) is stored locally. Images are found in public/ and all the flower data is currently stored as a .json under “dummyData.js” under src/components. It’s important to note that the functions rendering these images rely on the local path of the flower and “photoName” field in the flower data (i.e. it will do <img src=`/photos/bouquet_flowers/{flower.photoName}` />). You would need to consider and adjust this if you plan on implementing some online storage service and/or database.

### Running the App

To run the app, you can use the following scripts:

| Script         | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| npm start      | Runs the app in the development mode.               |
| npm run dev    | Alias for `npm start`.                              |
| npm run build  | Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder. |
| npm run serve  | Serves the production build from the `dist` folder. |
| npm test       | Starts a Jest-like test loop.                       |
